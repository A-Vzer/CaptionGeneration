Generate captions from image codes. This implementation is still under development. For some reason it performs worse than my TensorFlow implementation. 

Mobilenetv2 is taken from: https://github.com/d-li14/mobilenetv2.pytorch/blob/master/README.md
Dataset: Flickr8k, where caption.txt is in the `archive` folder and the images are in `archive/Images`.
